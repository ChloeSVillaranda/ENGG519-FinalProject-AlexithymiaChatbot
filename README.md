# Feelio by LexiFeel  
### Alexithymia Support Chatbot

Feelio by LexiFeel is a conversational AI chatbot designed to support individuals with **alexithymia**, a condition characterized by difficulty identifying, describing, and processing emotions. The chatbot aims to promote emotional awareness through structured, supportive dialogue while emphasizing transparency, trust, and human-centered AI principles.

This project was developed as the **final project for ENGG 519 – Human AI Interaction** as part of the **Biomedical Engineering Minor** at **University of Calgary**. The work explores how conversational agents can be designed responsibly to assist users in emotionally sensitive contexts without replacing professional mental health support.
